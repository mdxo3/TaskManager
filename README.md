# 📝 TaskManager MVC App

A full-featured task management web application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)** and **Entity Framework Core**.  
This project was developed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate practical skills in full-stack .NET development.

---

## 📌 What the Project Does

TaskManager is a simple yet powerful to-do list app that allows registered users to:

- ✅ Create, update, and delete personal tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed via checkbox (AJAX)  
- ✅ Set priorities and optional deadlines  
- ✅ Filter and sort tasks (e.g., by status, deadline, creation date)  
- ✅ Track when tasks were created or completed  
- ✅ Edit tasks directly from the list (inline editing)  
- ✅ Register and log in securely using ASP.NET Identity  

---

## 🌟 Why the Project Is Useful

This app shows a realistic example of how .NET 8 MVC apps are structured with user authentication, entity relationships, AJAX interactivity, and clean UI.  
It’s a great starting point for beginners and a solid codebase to build on for job seekers or hobby projects.
